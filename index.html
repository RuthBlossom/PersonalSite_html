              <td>I'm a lifelong learner who's passionate about coding. I believe that learning to code is one of the most valuable
          skills you can have in today's fast-paced digital world, and I'm committed to mastering this skill so I can make a
          positive impact on the world. I've been fascinated by the power of technology to transform our lives, and I'm
          excited to be part of the next generation of innovators who are shaping the digital world.
      
          In my journey as a coder, I've been inspired by a man I met while walking at a nearby dam, who is a passionate
          coder. I noticed his passion and excitment when he spoke about coding which inspired me to begin coding. I'm
          especially drawn to those who immerse themselves in coding and use their coding skills to make creative solutions. I
          was immediately fascinated by the power of code to create new products, solve complex problems, and connect people
          from all over the world.
      
          Since then, I've been teaching myself to code through a combination of online courses, tutorials, and personal
          projects. I intend on learning several programming languages, and I am planning on building a range of applications,
          from simple games to more complex web apps.
      
          What I love most about coding is the sense of accomplishment I feel when I see my code come to life. It's a feeling
          of creative empowerment that I've never experienced before, and it's what drives me to keep learning and growing as
          a coder.
      
          Outside of coding, I enjoy Graphic design, especially using creative tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe
          Illustrator.
          <br>
          I'm always happy to chat and meet with fellow coders and learn from their experiences. Let's code together.
